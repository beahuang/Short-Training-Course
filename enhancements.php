		<h3>Here are all the enhancements of assignment 1</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>I embedded a mp4 video using the video tag of html5. Letting a user easily see an example of a short training course. You can find this on the index page <a href="index.html" class="link">here</a></li>
			<li>I added in a css transition to the menu links for interactivity element when there is a hover effect a menu link and fixed the menu when you scroll for user experience</li>
			<li>I added in a before and after element with a transition on hover on any a link in copy so that it is clearly seen that it is a link. This is added on any a tag with the class "link" like <a href="" class="link">this tag</a></li>
		</ul>
